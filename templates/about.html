          <h2>Jinrun Han</h2>
          <p>
            Jin Han is one of Nerdboard's writers. Between being shouted at by racists and drinking under some stairs, she finds time to write blog posts and make beautiful short films. Her passions include Wetherspoons and talking (about movies, mostly).<br /><br />
            Jin is from LA but also grew up in Beijing, going to university in New York and Leeds - truly a global citizen! Her experiences form much of the inspiration of her work, but she's down to try anything once ;)

            <h2>David Oloko</h2>
            <p>
              Who is David Oloko you might ask? The man is many things, I mean, he has not one but SEVEN first names! First of all, David is definitely from Africa because where else would he be from? Just kidding, he’s actually from London you racist fuck. He has, however, lived in Ghana in his childhood which makes him a multicultural international ass ho. He majors in digital media at the University of Leeds and is currently the station manager of Leeds Student Television, the largest (and best) student television station in the UK. In his spare time, David is an avid Rocket League player, a dedicated single-father to his snowson, an aspiring cat person, and professional softie. David is also skilled in the craft of making burgers, writing comedy, graphic design, making people happy, being a snack, and doing things at the very last minute before the deadline. David’s greatest motivators in life are his deep passion for his art and a desire to be paid enough to survive.

          <h2>lizzie Sarell</h2>
          <p>
            When one thinks of an alleged coffee lover, avid baker and talented writer, only one person comes to mind on the Board of Nerds. Elizabeth 'Lizzie Loves Chocolate' Sarrell is truly a snack of all trades! With a love for musicals and a knack for coding, Lizzie is a true delight to have around... except for when she's reminding you about how she's lactose intolerant but other than that... you can always expect her to be writing, cooking or at the very least thinking of new ideas to show everyone! No matter what, you can always rely on the soon-to-be vegan Lizzie Sarrell (trust me, she says she won't but give it a month) to provide you with posts that are absurd yet entertaining.
